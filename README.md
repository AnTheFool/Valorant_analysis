# Valorant Gameplay Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Valorant gameplay data to provide players with actionable insights on performance, weapon usage, and match trends. Data is collected using the **Tracker.gg API**, processed in **Python**, and visualized using an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.

## Features
- **Automated Data Collection**: Extracts player performance statistics via the **Tracker.gg API**.
- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Uses **Pandas & NumPy** to refine raw `.json` data.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Provides an interactive visualization of match trends, agent usage, and key performance indicators.
- **Insights for Players**: Helps players optimize their strategies based on statistical trends.

## Tech Stack
- **Data Collection**: Tracker.gg API
- **Data Processing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization**: Power BI

## File Structure
- `draft.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for data extraction, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- `Valorant_analysis.pbix` – Power BI file for dashboard creation and visualization.

## How to Use
1. Run `draft.ipynb` to fetch and preprocess data.
2. Open `Valorant_analysis.pbix` in Power BI to explore visualized insights.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement advanced analytics (e.g., win prediction models).
- Expand dashboard to include more player performance metrics.
- Automate data refresh for real-time analysis.
